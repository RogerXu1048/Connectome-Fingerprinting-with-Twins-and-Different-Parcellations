# Connectome-Fingerprinting-with-Twins-with-Different-Parcellations
This project aims to investigate the identification accuracy of individuals using their resting-state fMRI scan data. We also explore the effect of using different brain parcellations on the identification accuracy. Twin data are also investigated to see whether twins can be identified based on the resting-state fMRI.
